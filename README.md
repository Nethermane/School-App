# Shool App
To get started please follow [his link](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment-(Eclipse,-Intellij-IDEA,-NetBeans)#setting-up-eclipse) to setup your development environment

*Below is optional, just nice to test eclipse is setup properly*

After your environment is setup you should be able to download and run the [setup application for libgdx] (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html)
Once downloaded run it.
(Make sure to go to advanced and click the Eclispe button, otherwise most other things don't matter, as this is a test)

It creates a number of projects for each device 

You import them into eclipse by going to eclipse, file, import, general, existing projects, then selecting the folder where you created the project in the GDX setup application.

Select all projects that it provides and import them. If your environment is setup properly, should only contain an error in the android project(disregard for now).

If this doesn't work of course troubleshoot or just message me and tell me what is breaking.

After your environment is setup properly download the 4 projects in this Git repository. Git is a useful tool for code sharing, but it is a bit complicated. I am personally using the Eclipse plugin EGit which allows me to push projects in on my computer directly to the cloud.
